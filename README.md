# xmas_markets_ch: analysis of swiss christmas market data
_Calvin Whealton_

Hoping to bring some data-driven Christmas cheer to everyone out there. I took data from <http://www.brunnvalla.ch/christmasmarkets/switzerland.html> and used it as the input. No fancy scraping, just hard copy and paste. I make some descriptive plots. I also got to play around with defining my own plotting symbols in R using the canton flags. :)
